//! Block arena for the orderbook.
//!
//! One account per market holds a fixed header followed by a flat array of
//! uniform 80-byte blocks. Orders are allocated from a free list inside that
//! array, and the two sides are intrusive sorted doubly-linked lists threaded
//! through the same blocks.
//!
//! ## Why this shape
//!
//! One account per market, rather than a PDA per `(market, side, tick)`. Rent
//! on Solana is `(128 + bytes) * 6960` lamports, so **every account carries a
//! 128-byte surcharge** — about $0.178. Split across accounts, a thin book of
//! 10 orders over 8 ticks would be 19 accounts and ~$7.06, of which $3.38 is
//! pure per-account overhead. Splitting state across accounts is what costs
//! money, not the bytes.
//!
//! Each such account would also have to be named, locked, and passed into the
//! transaction, capping a crossing buy at 5 fills: 3 accounts and 99 bytes per
//! fill against a 1232-byte packet limit.
//!
//! Consolidating into one account removes both problems at once. Phoenix does
//! this but preallocates (0.59-12 SOL per market); Manifest does it with
//! uniform blocks grown by `realloc` (0.0073 SOL). This is a launchpad with
//! many thin markets, so it follows Manifest.
//!
//! ## Ordering
//!
//! Strict **price-time priority**, maintained explicitly on insert. Bids sort
//! by descending price, asks by ascending price, and both break ties by
//! ascending `seq` — so at equal price the earlier order is always closer to
//! the head, and the matcher can simply walk from the head.
//!
//! FIFO here is explicit logic rather than a side effect of a per-tick `Vec`,
//! so it gets a real test: `insert_remove_preserves_price_time` drives
//! thousands of randomised operations and re-verifies the ordering, the free
//! list, and the block count after every single one.
//!
//! ## Why a linked list and not a red-black tree
//!
//! Insert is O(n). For the book sizes a prediction market actually sees (tens
//! of orders) that is a few hundred CU of pointer chasing, against ~600 lines
//! for a balanced tree. The block layout is deliberately tree-compatible —
//! `next`/`prev` become child pointers — so the index can be swapped later
//! without touching the arena, the settlement layer, or the wire format.
//! Ship the list; earn the tree.

///   - rent, ~1.83 SOL at full extension (0.116 at 256);
///   - Solana's 10 MiB account limit, which is 163,840 blocks.
