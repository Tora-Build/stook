//! Matching: walk the opposite side, settle each fill, rest the remainder.
//!
//! This is the loop whose per-fill cost sets the book's ceiling. A fill touches
//! nothing outside the book account the instruction already holds: the maker's
//! order, the maker's seat and the taker's seat are all blocks in the same
//! arena. **Zero accounts and zero bytes per fill**, so the ceiling is set by
//! compute alone — where a layout needing 3 accounts and 99 transaction bytes
//! per fill would cap a crossing buy at 5 against the 1232-byte packet limit.
//!
//! Token movement is deliberately absent. Fills credit `SeatNode::credit`; a
//! separate `withdraw` turns credit into USDC. That is Phoenix's seat model, and
//! it is what removes the per-fill SPL transfer — one CPI per *transaction*
//! instead of one per *fill*.
