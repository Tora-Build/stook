//! `close_market` — reclaim a finished market's rent, without enabling
//! resurrection.
//!
//! ## Why the Market account is NOT deleted
//!
//! Every per-market PDA — `AmmState`, the book, the fee pools, and every
//! user's `Position` — derives from `market_id`, and `market_id` is a
//! caller-supplied argument to `create_market`. If closing a market returned
//! the Market account to the system program, `create_market` could be called
//! again with the same id: the new market would land at the same address, and
//! every surviving `Position` from the OLD market would deserialize cleanly
//! against the NEW one. A trader whose 700 losing shares expired worthless
//! could re-create the id, seed a thin market, and sell those shares into
//! other people's fresh collateral.
//!
//! So the Market account stays alive as a TOMBSTONE: shrunk to 8 bytes,
//! discriminator overwritten with a marker that is not any Anchor account's,
//! rent above the 8-byte minimum refunded. `create_market` allocates the
//! Market PDA through `pda::create_pda_account`, which refuses any target
//! this program already owns — the tombstone is exactly that — and every
//! other instruction that loads `Account<Market>` fails its discriminator
//! check. The tombstone poisons the whole id, which is exactly the point.
//! Cost: ~0.001 SOL per market stays locked forever, out of ~0.017 reclaimed.
//!
//! The refusal is an explicit ownership check, not a side effect of
//! `create_account` rejecting a funded account: that older behaviour also let
//! one lamport censor an unborn market, so it had to go. See `crate::pda`.
//!
//! ## Why the preconditions are balances, not time
//!
//! There is no `settled_at` on chain, so "the claim window has passed" is not
//! provable. What IS provable is that nobody is owed anything: every claim a
//! user can make — winner redemption, seat credit, resting-order escrow,
//! sell-lock, accrued fees — is paid from one of the five token accounts this
//! instruction requires to be EMPTY. Zero balances mean every remaining claim
//! is a claim on nothing, so closing strands no value. A market that cannot
//! reach zero (an absent maker's resting escrow, an unclaimed lock) simply
//! cannot be closed; that is the honest outcome, not a bug.
//!
//! The book, when it exists, must also carry no live orders and no seat with
//! net exposure or credit. `vault_book == 0` already implies those are
//! worthless, but if they are nonzero over an empty vault something upstream
//! was insolvent — and destroying the ledger that proves it is the wrong
//! response to that discovery.
//!
//! ## Who
//!
//! The creator signs and receives the rent — they paid it at creation. The
//! lamport destinations are fixed by that same constraint, so there is
//! nothing here for a third party to redirect.
//!
//! Not closeable, documented rather than hidden: the LP mint. Classic SPL
//! mints have no close authority, so its 0.0015 SOL is stranded by SPL's own
//! rules, not ours.
