//! `redeem_lp` — burn post-graduation LP shares for pro-rata yield from
//! BOTH venues, in one instruction.
//!
//! ## Why one burn pays two vaults
//!
//! LP yield accrues in two currencies: the AMM's fees in its own token, the
//! book's in USDC. The LP token is the claim on both — so a redemption that
//! paid only one venue and burned the LP would silently forfeit the holder's
//! share of the other. Splitting this into two instructions would need
//! per-holder claimed-per-venue bookkeeping to prevent exactly that; one
//! atomic burn needs none.
//!
//! ## Why the vaults are per-market
//!
//! The yield vaults are seeded by `market_id`, so each market's yield is
//! claimable only against its own LP supply. A global vault would let payout
//! divide the GLOBAL pool by THIS market's LP supply — a dust market's sole
//! LP could take every market's yield.
//!
//! ## When this path is closed
//!
//! Payout is `vault * lp_amount / supply`, so a zero supply has no answer and
//! this instruction refuses it. LP tokens are ordinary SPL tokens and a holder
//! can `burn` them directly, so a supply CAN reach zero with the vaults still
//! funded. `sweep_lp_yield` is the recovery for exactly that state: it sends
//! the remainder to the treasury, since the holders who could have claimed it
//! destroyed their claim. This instruction stays the only path while any LP
//! token exists.
