//! `init_market_fee_pool` — create the per-market fee plumbing: two fee
//! pools AND two LP yield vaults, one of each per venue.
//!
//! An SPL token account holds exactly one mint, so the AMM's money (its own
//! token) and the book's (USDC) physically cannot share accounts. All four
//! are created in one instruction so a market cannot end up with half its
//! plumbing.
//!
//! ## Why the yield vaults are PER-MARKET
//!
//! Seeding the vaults by `market_id` makes each market's yield claimable only
//! against its own LP supply. `lp_yield_authority` is a global singleton, so
//! "the ATA of that authority for the AMM mint" would be ONE account for the
//! whole protocol: every market's `distribute_fees` would pay into it, and
//! `redeem_lp` would pay out `global_vault × lp / THIS market's supply`. The
//! sole LP of a dust market could burn 100% of a supply of one and take every
//! other market's accumulated yield, first to redeem winning.
