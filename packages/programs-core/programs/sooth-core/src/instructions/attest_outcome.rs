//! `attest_outcome` — Manual variant. The per-market authority signs a
//! `winning_outcome`, recording it on the `AdjudicatorEntry`.
//!
//! It does NOT settle. The market stays `Locked` and enters the ATTESTED
//! state for `VETO_PERIOD_SECS`, during which `dispute` may override the
//! outcome; after that window anyone may call `settle` to finalize.
//!
//! Attest and settle MUST stay separate instructions: `dispute` requires
//! both `is_attested()` and a not-yet-`Settled` market, so collapsing
//! attest+settle into one transaction would leave no market ever in both
//! states at once and make every dispute fail with `MarketAlreadySettled`
//! or `NotYetAttested`. `sdk-solana/tests/adjudicator-flow.test.ts` pins
//! both branches. The split matches the EVM contract, where `resolve` and
//! a permissionless `settle` are distinct calls either side of
//! `vetoEndsAt`.
