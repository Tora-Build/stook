//! `reclaim_subsidy` — return the unspent LMSR subsidy to the creator after
//! settlement.
//!
//! ## What this returns
//!
//! `seed_lp` requires the creator to post `b·ln(2)` into the market vault. That
//! is the maximum the LMSR can ever lose, not what it *will* lose: fees repay
//! it as the market trades, and a market that never moves much gives most of it
//! back. This instruction is the only path that returns the unspent portion.
//!
//! Paying it out safely means knowing everything the vault still owes, and an
//! UNDER-count is an over-payment taken out of traders' collateral.
//!
//! There is exactly **one** ledger to count: AMM positions, aggregated in
//! `AmmState.q_yes` / `q_no`. The subsidy is posted in the AMM token and is
//! returned from the AMM vault, so the book — a different vault holding a
//! different mint — is not this instruction's business. Counting its seats
//! here would subtract book obligations from the AMM residual and strand the
//! creator's capital.
//!
//! ## The two guards
//!
//! **Residual.** Pay only `vault - obligations`. If the arithmetic is right,
//! that money is owed to nobody.
//!
//! **Cap.** Never pay more than the subsidy actually posted, less what has
//! already been reclaimed. This is defence in depth, and it is what bounds the
//! damage of a mistake: an under-counted obligation can, at worst, hand back
//! the creator's own capital early. It can never reach into trading profits.
//!
//! ## Dismissal, and the obligation that gates it
//!
//! A dismissed market refunds every position at COST — `Position
//! .locked_cost_usdc` — and that pot is not self-funding. Writing `net_i` for
//! a position's buys minus its sell proceeds, the vault holds
//! `seed + Σ net_i` while refunds owe `Σ max(net_i, 0)`, because a position
//! that exited at a profit floors at zero instead of going negative. The
//! difference is exactly `seed − P`, where `P` is the profit already
//! withdrawn by traders who round-tripped before the dismissal. The creator's
//! subsidy IS the collateral for those refunds, so it must not leave while
//! one is outstanding.
//!
//! `AmmState.refund_obligation_usdc` is that outstanding total, maintained by
//! every path that moves a `locked_cost_usdc`. So a dismissed market's
//! subsidy is reclaimable exactly when the counter reads zero — every refund
//! claimed or extinguished — and not before.
//!
//! The counter reads zero on accounts written before it existed, and zero is
//! the direction that pays out: it would report "nothing owed" for a market
//! whose every refund is still unclaimed. `AmmState.tracks_refund_obligation`
//! separates the two — set by `create_market`, clear on every legacy account
//! — and a dismissed market whose counter is untracked is refused exactly as
//! it was before the counter existed. Its subsidy stays stranded and
//! `close_market` cannot run on it; that is the honest cost of not being able
//! to reconstruct `P` for a market nobody was counting.
//!
//! ## Why it is callable repeatedly
//!
//! Obligations shrink as traders redeem, so the free residual grows over time.
//! A single-shot instruction would force the creator to guess when to fire it,
//! and guessing early means leaving their own money behind permanently.
