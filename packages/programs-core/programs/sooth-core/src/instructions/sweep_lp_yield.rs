//! `sweep_lp_yield` — recover an LP-yield balance no LP token can claim.
//!
//! Its own module rather than a second handler inside `sweep_residual`: it
//! claims BOTH venues' yield vaults, and the venue-separation invariant is
//! asserted per source file (see `packages/sdk-solana/tests/venue-separation.test.ts`).
//! `redeem_lp` mixes venues for the same reason and is exempted the same way.
//!
//! ## The stranding
//!
//! `redeem_lp` is the only path out of the two per-market LP yield vaults,
//! and it divides by `lp_mint.supply`, so it needs a live supply and a holder
//! to burn. But LP tokens are ordinary SPL tokens: a holder can call the
//! token program's `burn` directly and destroy their claim without ever
//! touching `redeem_lp`. If the last holder does that, supply hits zero while
//! the vaults still hold everything `distribute_fees` paid in beforehand.
//!
//! That balance is then unreachable — and `close_market` requires every token
//! account at zero, so the market is also unclosable, its rent locked and its
//! vaults frozen. `distribute_fees_amm`/`_book` already fold the LP slice
//! into the protocol remainder once supply is zero, so this instruction is
//! only about what arrived BEFORE that: the two rules together mean the
//! vaults always drain.
//!
//! ## Why the treasury
//!
//! The claimants, ranked:
//!
//! - **Remaining LP holders** would be the right answer, but the precondition
//!   is that there are none: supply is zero, so no token exists to pay.
//! - **The LP holders who burned** destroyed their own claim by choosing a
//!   raw `burn` over `redeem_lp`. Nothing on chain records who they were —
//!   the position that would say is gone with the tokens — so paying them is
//!   not merely unfair, it is not expressible.
//! - **The creator** has a separate, capped claim (`reclaim_subsidy`, limited
//!   to what they posted) and this is not part of it. Routing fee revenue to
//!   the creator would also pay whoever induced the burn, and creator and LP
//!   are usually the same key here — turning a mistake into a payout.
//! - **The treasury** is what the protocol already does with an unclaimable
//!   LP slice: `distribute_fees_*` sends it there the moment supply is zero.
//!   Sweeping the earlier balance to the same place makes one rule out of
//!   two, rather than adding a second policy for the same money.
//!
//! ## Who may call
//!
//! Anyone, like `sweep_residual` and fee distribution: the destinations are
//! `token::authority = config.treasury`, pinned exactly as in
//! `distribute_fees`, so a cranker picks nothing. Gating it on an authority
//! would let one absent keeper hold a market's close hostage.
//!
//! ## Why a lifecycle gate is required
//!
//! Zero supply is not by itself terminal. `trade_positions` mints LP to the
//! BUYER on every pre-graduation trade, so an incubating market can go to
//! zero supply and back the moment somebody trades. Sweeping there would take
//! a vault the next LP was about to have a claim on.
//!
//! So this opens on exactly the condition `redeem_lp` opens on — graduated,
//! settled, or dismissed. Each one ends LP minting for good: `trade_positions`
//! mints only while `!graduated`, and a settled or dismissed market does not
//! trade at all. The two instructions therefore unlock together, and between
//! them the vaults always drain: a live supply redeems, a dead one sweeps.
