//! `sweep_residual` — move a settled market's unowed AMM surplus to the
//! treasury, so the vault can reach zero and the market can be closed.
//!
//! ## Why a surplus exists at all
//!
//! The LMSR collects more than it pays out: the cost function's curvature is
//! the traders' aggregate loss, and fees' `b_base` slice is returned to the
//! vault by `distribute_fees`. After every winner has redeemed and the
//! creator has reclaimed their subsidy, the vault still holds that surplus,
//! and no other instruction can touch it: `reclaim_subsidy` is capped at what
//! the creator posted, redemptions are capped at shares held. Without this
//! sweep the money would be stranded, and `close_market` blocked with it.
//!
//! ## Why sweeping is safe — the outstanding-claims gate
//!
//! The danger is sweeping money that still backs a claim: an unredeemed
//! winner's payout looks exactly like surplus to a naive balance check. The
//! gate is exact, not heuristic:
//!
//!   `AmmState.q_<winner>` counts winning shares outstanding, and
//!   `seed_q_<winner>` is the virtual floor seeded at creation that no
//!   Position ever backs. `redeem_amm_position` decrements `q` as it
//!   pays, so `q_winner == seed_q_winner` holds exactly when every real
//!   winning share has been redeemed — and only then is the remaining
//!   balance provably owed to nobody.
//!
//! An INVALID outcome pays both legs, so both sides must be drained to their
//! floors.
//!
//! ## Where it goes, and who may call
//!
//! To the protocol treasury, pinned the same way `distribute_fees` pins it:
//! `token::authority = config.treasury`, so a permissionless cranker chooses
//! nothing. Not to the creator — the surplus is trader losses, and letting
//! the market's own creator harvest them buys the wrong incentive for the
//! price of a convenience.
//!
//! Book-venue residuals need no sweep: the book is zero-sum between seats
//! (fees leave via the fee pool), so `vault_book` reaches zero organically
//! once every seat withdraws.
//!
//! The LP yield vaults strand for a different reason and are recovered by
//! `sweep_lp_yield`, in its own module: it names both venues' mints, and the
//! venue-separation invariant is asserted per source file.
