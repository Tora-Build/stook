//! `request_lock` — the PERMISSIONLESS half of Open → Locked.
//!
//! ## Two instructions, two roles
//!
//! Locking a market is reachable two ways, and they are deliberately not the
//! same instruction:
//!
//!   - [`lock_for_resolution`](super::lock_for_resolution) is the
//!     **adjudicator's** lock. It fires at ANY time, deadline or not, because
//!     a Sooth market asks "will X happen BY time T". Once X has happened the
//!     question is answered, and continuing to trade a settled fact is free
//!     money against anyone with a stale order. Early locking is therefore the
//!     trust model, not an oversight: the adjudicator is trusted to say when
//!     the answer is known, and `attest` + the veto window + `dispute` are
//!     what bound that trust.
//!
//!   - `request_lock` is **anyone's** lock, and only once the advertised
//!     deadline has passed. At that instant every trading path already refuses
//!     — `trade_positions` and `sell_positions` require `now < deadline`, and
//!     so does `book_place` — so the transition records a fact that is already
//!     true, and no signer is privileged enough to be worth requiring.
//!
//! ## Why it is permissionless
//!
//! `settle` requires `Locked`. If the lock were adjudicator-only, a lost key
//! or a departed operator would pin a market in `Open` forever, and with it
//! every AMM position, book seat, LP stake and escrowed sell in it — none of
//! which has a payout path that does not run through settlement. Making the
//! post-deadline transition permissionless removes one key from that critical
//! path.
//!
//! It does not remove the other on its own: `settle` still needs an attested
//! outcome. `force_invalid_attestation` supplies one after
//! `ABANDONED_MARKET_TIMEOUT_SECS`, and requires `Locked` to do it — so this
//! instruction is the first step of that rescue, and deliberately does not
//! require the market to have an `AdjudicatorEntry` at all.
//!
//! ## What a post-deadline lock can and cannot do to someone
//!
//! Locking cannot grief a trader: after the deadline every venue has already
//! stopped accepting orders, and the two paths that must stay open to an exit
//! — `book_cancel` and `claim_unlocked` — are gated on neither the lifecycle
//! nor the deadline.
//!
//! It does close one door on the CREATOR: `dismiss_market` requires an `Open`
//! market, so a permissionless lock ends the option to dismiss and refund at
//! cost, leaving resolution as the only exit. That is the intended ordering —
//! after the deadline the question's window has closed and holders are owed an
//! outcome, not a rewind — and the creator keeps the whole trial window before
//! the deadline to dismiss. The same door was already closable at will by the
//! adjudicator through `lock_for_resolution`.
