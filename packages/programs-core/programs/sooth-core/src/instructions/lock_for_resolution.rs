//! `lock_for_resolution` — the ADJUDICATOR's Open → Locked, callable at any
//! time.
//!
//! ## Early locking is the trust model
//!
//! A Sooth market asks "will X happen BY time T", not "at time T". So when X
//! happens early the question is already answered, and every further trade is
//! free money taken from whoever has not noticed yet. The adjudicator may
//! therefore freeze trading the moment the answer is known — before the
//! deadline, deliberately — and attest immediately.
//!
//! That is authority, and it is bounded rather than absolute: locking decides
//! only WHEN trading stops. The outcome still goes through `attest_outcome`,
//! sits out `ProtocolConfig.veto_period_secs` where `dispute` can override it,
//! and only then does the permissionless `settle` make it final.
//!
//! ## The other door
//!
//! `request_lock` performs the same transition with no privileged signer, but
//! only once `market.deadline` has passed — by then every venue has already
//! stopped accepting orders on its own. The two are not redundant: this one is
//! trusted and early, that one is public and late, and the late one is what
//! keeps a market from sitting `Open` forever if this key is lost.
//!
//! Auth is via `AdjudicatorEntry` directly — the signer must be
//! `adjudicator_entry.authority`.
