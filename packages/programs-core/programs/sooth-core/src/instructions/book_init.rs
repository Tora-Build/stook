//! `book_init` and `book_grow` — create the per-market book and extend it.
//!
//! Split into two instructions because Solana caps `realloc` at
//! [`MAX_PERMITTED_DATA_INCREASE`] (10,240 bytes) **per instruction**, measured
//! from the account's length at instruction entry. At 64 bytes per block that
//! is 160 blocks a call, so reaching [`MAX_ORDERS`] from empty takes several
//! calls. A single `init` that tried to allocate the maximum would simply
//! fail.
//!
//! The account is created by hand rather than with Anchor's `init` because it
//! is loaded by raw cast — there is no `#[account]` type for Anchor to size or
//! deserialize, and its length changes over the market's life.
