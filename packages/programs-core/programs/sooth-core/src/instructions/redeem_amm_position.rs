//! `redeem_amm_position` — pay out an AMM `Position` after settlement.
//!
//! ## Why this exists
//!
//! `trade_positions` credits `Position.yes_shares` / `no_shares` and takes the
//! user's USDC into the AMM vault; this instruction is the ONLY path that pays
//! a settled AMM position back out:
//!
//!   - `claim_refund` is gated on dismissal and on the market not having
//!     settled, so it does not apply to a market that settled normally.
//!     Settlement and dismissal exclude each other, and this instruction also
//!     clears the position's refund accounting — a deposit is paid once, on
//!     exactly one of the two paths.
//!   - `sell_positions` requires `market.is_open()`, so it stops working the
//!     moment the market locks.
//!
//! The payout rule mirrors the book's `redeem_book_seat` exactly — same
//! winning-side logic, same INVALID split, same floor conversion — so the two
//! ledgers pay out identically and neither can drift from the other.
//!
//! ## Why this does NOT close the Position account
//!
//! `claim_unlocked` requires the `Position` PDA to exist (it derives the
//! `LockEntry` seeds from `position.key()` and checks `position.bump`). A user
//! who sold before settlement has outstanding `LockEntry` accounts holding real
//! USDC; closing their `Position` here would strand that USDC.
//!
//! So the shares are zeroed and the account is left in place. That leaks the
//! Position's rent (~0.00083 SOL), which is the strictly safer trade. Reclaiming
//! it needs an outstanding-lock counter — cheap to add later, since `Position`
//! carries 32 reserved bytes.
//!
//! ## T\* voiding
//!
//! A market whose adjudicator published a `ResolutionCommitment` pays from a
//! per-wallet ENTITLEMENT — shares acquired at or before T\*, plus the cost of
//! everything acquired after it, refunded — instead of from the raw position.
//! The wallet carries a merkle proof; the program verifies it against the
//! published root. Mechanism and trust model: `docs/design/t-star-voiding.md`.
//!
//! Two properties hold that guard against every ordinary market:
//!
//!   - The commitment PDA is a REQUIRED account, pinned by seeds. A program
//!     cannot detect an account it was not handed, so an optional one — or a
//!     second "voided redeem" instruction beside an untouched original —
//!     would leave the full-payout path as a bypass for anyone who preferred it.
//!   - An uninitialised account at that address is the honest, overwhelmingly
//!     common state and means "no voiding": the handler then behaves exactly
//!     as it did before this path existed, and refuses a claim if one is
//!     supplied anyway.
