//! `publish_resolution_commitment` / `revoke_resolution_commitment` — the
//! adjudicator's commitment to a T\* voiding computation, and the veto over it.
//!
//! The mechanism and its trust model are in `docs/design/t-star-voiding.md`.
//! What matters here is the timing, because the timing IS the enforcement:
//!
//!   - Publication is only accepted while the market is `Locked`, the outcome
//!     is attested, and the veto window is still OPEN. So a commitment always
//!     lands in front of the same 24h of public scrutiny as the outcome it
//!     accompanies, and always before `settle` — which is the first moment any
//!     position can redeem against it.
//!   - Revocation is only accepted inside that same window. After it closes
//!     the commitment is final, exactly as the outcome is.
//!
//! A published root is not trusted, it is CHECKABLE: the leaf table is a pure
//! function of the market's public event tape, so any observer can recompute
//! the root and see that it differs. `revoke_resolution_commitment` is what
//! they can then have the dispute authority do — after which the market
//! redeems as if voiding had never been attempted.
//!
//! Publication is one-shot: the PDA is created with `init`, so a second call
//! fails on the account already existing. Amending a commitment mid-window
//! would let a resolver publish a decoy, wait out the observers, and swap it.
