//! `claim_refund` — refund a dismissed-market AMM Position.
//!
//! ## Why a refund can be short, and what is paid then
//!
//! Dismissal refunds at COST: every position is owed its
//! `Position.locked_cost_usdc`, and that pot is not self-funding. Writing
//! `net_i` for a position's buys minus its sell proceeds, the vault holds
//! `seed + Σ net_i` while refunds owe `Σ max(net_i, 0)` — a position that
//! exited at a profit floors at zero instead of going negative. The
//! difference is `seed − P`, where `P` is profit already withdrawn by traders
//! who round-tripped before the dismissal. When `P` exceeds the creator's
//! seed the vault cannot cover every refund.
//!
//! Paying each claim in full until the vault empties makes that a race, and
//! the loser is whoever claims last — someone who did nothing but hold. So
//! short vaults pay PRO-RATA: `locked_cost × vault ÷ obligation`, where the
//! obligation is `AmmState.refund_obligation_usdc`, the running sum of every
//! position's claim.
//!
//! The ratio is order-independent without snapshotting it. Paying `L·r` out
//! of `(V, O)` with `r = V/O` leaves `(V − L·r, O − L)`, whose ratio is
//! `(V − LV/O)/(O − L) = V/O = r` exactly. Every claimant therefore meets the
//! same `r` whenever they arrive, and the floor division's dust accrues to
//! whoever claims later — the opposite of a race's incentive.
//!
//! It is final rather than provisional because a dismissed market's vault has
//! no further inflows: buying is closed, and the seed is already in. There is
//! no later top-up for a second pass to distribute.
//!
//! ## Prevention was the alternative, and it costs more than it saves
//!
//! The shortfall could be designed away by refusing to pay out a profitable
//! round trip — but that is the AMM refusing to be an AMM, on every market,
//! to protect against a dismissal that usually never comes. Pro-rata prices
//! the rare case instead of taxing the common one.
//!
//! ## Legacy accounts
//!
//! `AmmState.refund_obligation_usdc` reads zero on every account written
//! before it existed, and zero is the over-paying direction. The denominator
//! is therefore `max(obligation, locked_cost)` — a market's obligation can
//! never be smaller than the one claim in front of us — and the payout is
//! capped at the vault balance. An untracked market degrades to the old
//! first-come-first-served behaviour, but the last claimant now receives the
//! remainder instead of a failed transfer.
