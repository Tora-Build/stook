//! `settle` — finalize an attested market once its veto window has closed.
//!
//! Permissionless, and takes no outcome argument. Both are deliberate:
//!
//!   - **Permissionless.** The outcome is already fixed on the
//!     `AdjudicatorEntry` by `attest_outcome`; settle only moves the
//!     lifecycle. Requiring the adjudicator to come back would make
//!     finalization — and therefore every redemption — depend on one key
//!     staying live. Mirrors EVM, where `settle(address market)` is callable
//!     by anyone after `vetoEndsAt`.
//!
//!   - **No `winning_outcome` argument.** It is read from the entry, so the
//!     attested value is the only thing that can be finalized. Accepting an
//!     outcome from the caller would make the veto window meaningless:
//!     dispute the attestation all you like, settle could pass something
//!     else.
//!
//! ## The abandonment escape hatch
//!
//! `settle` requires an attested outcome, so an adjudicator who vanishes
//! between the lock and the attestation freezes the market — and with it every
//! position, LP stake and escrowed sell inside it, none of which has a payout
//! path that does not run through settlement. `force_invalid_attestation`,
//! below, is the door out: after [`ABANDONED_MARKET_TIMEOUT_SECS`] past the
//! market's own deadline, ANYONE may write `INVALID` onto the entry, and the
//! ordinary `settle` finalizes it once the ordinary veto window has run.

/// How long after a market's DEADLINE anyone may force it to `INVALID`.
///
/// ## Why fourteen days
///
/// The number has to sit above every honest delay and below "the money is
/// gone". An adjudicator resolves manually, so the honest tail includes a
/// long weekend, a public holiday, an event whose official result is itself
/// published late, and a key rotation — days, not hours. Seven days clears a
/// weekend but is still inside the range where "on leave" is an ordinary
/// explanation. Fourteen is not: a market two weeks past its own advertised
/// deadline with no outcome recorded is abandoned by any reasonable reading,
/// and the holders' money has been immobile for a fortnight.
///
/// Nothing is lost by erring long, either, because this is not the only
/// protection: forcing INVALID does not settle anything on its own. It opens
/// the ordinary veto window, so the true resolution can still arrive — by the
/// authority attesting over it, or by the dispute authority correcting it —
/// for `veto_period_secs` afterwards. Worst case the funds are freed at
/// `deadline + 14d + veto`, ~15 days.
///
/// ## Why it runs from the DEADLINE and not from the lock
///
/// Two reasons, and the first is decisive:
///
///   - **The lock time is not recorded.** Neither `Market` nor
///     `AdjudicatorEntry` stores one (`AdjudicatorEntry` has a single spare
///     byte left), so "time since the lock" is not a quantity this program
///     can evaluate at all.
///   - **The deadline is the honest clock even if it were.** A lock may land
///     arbitrarily EARLY — `lock_for_resolution` is deliberately callable the
///     moment the adjudicator believes the answer is known, which can be
///     months before the deadline. A lock-relative timeout would then let a
///     market be voided while its question was still genuinely open, which is
///     a far worse failure than a slow refund. The deadline, by contrast, is
///     advertised at creation and known to everyone who ever traded the
///     market, so a timeout measured from it surprises nobody.
///
/// The cost of the choice: a market locked long before its deadline waits
/// until `deadline + 14d`, not `lock + 14d`. That is the safe direction.
///
/// ## Where this lives
///
/// Beside its only consumer rather than in `constants.rs`. It is not
/// configuration — `ProtocolConfig` has no field for it and adding one would
/// change an account layout — and the reasoning above is the kind that has to
/// travel with the number.
