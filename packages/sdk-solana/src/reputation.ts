// Adjudicator reputation, computed — never asserted.
//
// The whole record is a pure fold over `MarketResolutionState`s the client
// already reads, so anyone can recompute any score from public chain state.
// That is the point: a reputation a platform hands down is another thing to
// trust; a reputation derived from verifiable history is not.
//
// ── The scoring model, and why each case scores what it does ──────────────
//
// An authority can touch a market in two roles, and both are scored:
//
// RULINGS (as the attesting authority):
//   clean        +10   Ruled, nobody vetoed, market settled as ruled. The
//                      whole job, done.
//   prompt bonus  +2   The ruling landed within 6h of becoming possible
//                      (early resolutions count as instant). Adjudication
//                      that keeps capital locked for days is worth less.
//   pending        0   Ruled, veto window still running. Not yet evidence.
//   overridden   -20   The guardian veto replaced this ruling. The veto is
//                      this protocol's court of last resort, so being
//                      overridden is the strongest negative signal the chain
//                      records about a ruling. Twice the clean reward:
//                      one bad ruling should not wash out with one good one.
//   forcedInvalid -12  The abandonment hatch fired on their watch. Less
//                      damning than a veto (nobody said the ruling was
//                      WRONG — they said it never came), still a failure.
//   unresponsive  -5   Market locked awaiting their ruling for over 48h.
//                      Scored per market, not per day, so it cannot dwarf
//                      the ruling scores.
//
// VETOES (as the dispute authority):
//   vetoOverProof -10  A veto that overrode a zkTLS-attested outcome. The
//                      proof is cryptographic evidence of what the data
//                      source served; overriding it is either a rescue of a
//                      genuinely broken rule (rare, legitimate) or an abuse
//                      of the guardian key. The score assumes accountability:
//                      guardians who override proofs must spend reputation
//                      to do it.
//   vetoManual     0   A veto on a MANUAL ruling is the guardian doing the
//                      exact job the protocol gives them, and the chain
//                      holds no higher truth to grade it against — the veto
//                      IS the final word on manual markets. It is counted
//                      and displayed (a guardian who vetoes everything looks
//                      exactly as strange as they are) but not scored.
//
// A note on "correct vs wrong" vetoes: on manual markets no on-chain oracle
// outranks the guardian, so correctness is not computable — pretending
// otherwise would be a number wearing a costume. Where ground truth DOES
// exist (zk proofs), vetoes are graded against it. The `DisputeRaised` event
// preserves the pre-veto ruling, so an event-level enrichment can later add
// per-dispute detail without changing this model.
//
// The composite starts at 50 (a stranger, not a villain) and moves with
// evidence; the tier is gated on VOLUME as well as score, so three lucky
// rulings cannot mint a "trusted" badge.
