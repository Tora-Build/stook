// No instruction may straddle the two venues.
//
// The AMM trades in one token and the book in another, so every instruction
// that touches money belongs to exactly one of them. Getting a single line
// wrong — the AMM's mint constant beside the book's vault, say — mixes
// currencies, and it does so SILENTLY: the constraint still compiles, the
// account still exists, and the failure only appears when a real transfer
// moves the wrong token or a solvency check reads the wrong pot.
//
// There are ~30 such lines across 15 instructions. Reviewing them once proves
// nothing about the next edit, so the invariant is asserted from the source
// itself: for each instruction, collect every venue-bearing symbol it mentions
// — `AMM_TOKEN_MINT` / `BOOK_TOKEN_MINT`, `market.vault_amm` /
// `market.vault_book`, `fee_pool_amm` / `fee_pool_book` — and require they all
// name the same venue.
//
// Two instructions legitimately mention both because they CREATE both, and
// they are named here rather than pattern-matched, so adding a third
// mixed-venue instruction is a decision someone has to make explicitly.
