`SolanaChainAdapter` is the whole surface: it reads protocol state, builds every
`sooth_core` instruction, simulates, signs, and submits. The frontend in this
repo (`apps/demo`, through its chain-shim) uses nothing else to reach the chain.

The public API third parties build against is documented in
[`docs/integrator-contract.md`](./docs/integrator-contract.md); how it is
implemented is in [`docs/implementation-guide.md`](./docs/implementation-guide.md).
If the two ever disagree, the integrator contract wins.

## What it does

**Reads**

- `readSnapshot(market, user?)` / `readSnapshots(markets[])` — `Market`,
  `AmmState`, and the caller's `Position`
- `readQuote(market, outcome, deltaShares)` — LMSR cost computed client-side, no
  RPC round-trip
- `readPosition`, `readAmmState`, `readLpRedemption`
- `readGraduationProgress(market)` — accrued fees against the `b·ln(2)` threshold
- `readMarketQuestion(market)` — the question text, recovered from the
  `MarketCreated` event. The `Market` account stores only `sha256(question)`;
  `create_market` verifies the text against that hash and re-emits it, which is
  what lets titles render with no indexer
- `readMarketTrades(market, {limit})` / `readBookHistory` — price history decoded
  from events, AMM and book on one YES-price axis
- `readBook(market)` — the live order book
- `readAdjudicator`, `readPendingUnlocks`, `readVenueFeeBps`

**Builds**

- Creation and liquidity: `buildCreateMarket` (defaults `market_id` to the first
  16 bytes of `sha256(question)`; `marketIdForQuestion` is exported),
  `buildSeedLp`
- AMM: `buildTrade` (buy), `buildSell`, `buildClaim`
- Book: `buildBookPlace`, `buildBookCancel`, `buildBookCancelMany`,
  `buildBookWithdraw`
- Resolution and payout: `buildRequestLock`, `buildAttestOutcome`,
  `buildSettle`, `buildRedeemAmmPosition`, `buildRedeemBookSeat`,
  `buildClaimRefund`, `buildDismissMarket`
- LP, fees, end of life: `buildRedeemLp`, `buildDistributeFees`,
  `buildReclaimSubsidy`, `buildSweepResidual`, `buildCloseMarket`

**Submits** — `preflight` simulates before signing; `submit` sets a compute-unit
price, salts duplicate transactions, and retries on a stale blockhash. Errors
come back as `SoothError`, classified from the program's Anchor codes.

Every built transaction prepends
`ComputeBudgetInstruction.requestHeapFrame(256 * 1024)`. `sooth_core` runs a
custom bump allocator over that region and aborts without it, so the adapter
adds it on all paths — including read-only simulations.

`buildTrade({ side: "sell" })` throws with a "use buildSell()" hint. The split
mirrors the on-chain one between `trade_positions` and `sell_positions`, because
sells escrow their proceeds.

Five interface methods throw `NotImplemented` on purpose rather than returning
empty values — `readPortfolio`, `subscribeMarketEvents`,
`subscribePositionEvents`, `getCollateralBalance`, `buildApprove`. Reasons are
in the integrator contract, §8; build a portfolio from `readSnapshots` +
`readPosition` + `readPendingUnlocks`.

## Quick usage

```ts
import {
  SolanaChainAdapter, encodePubkeyRef, SIDE_BID, ONE_SHARE,
} from "@sooth/sdk-solana";

const adapter = new SolanaChainAdapter({
  node: {
    id: "solana-devnet",
    chainKind: "solana",
    chainId: "solana:devnet",
    cluster: "devnet",
    rpcUrl: "https://api.devnet.solana.com",
  },
});

const market = encodePubkeyRef(marketPda);
const snap = await adapter.readSnapshot(market);
const book = await adapter.readBook(market);

const req = await adapter.buildBookPlace(market, {
  side: SIDE_BID,
  limitTick: 620,          // 1..999 on a single YES price axis
  amount: 50n * ONE_SHARE,
  matchLimit: 64,
  postRemainder: true,
  user: encodePubkeyRef(wallet.publicKey),
});

const sim = await adapter.preflight(req);
if (!sim.ok) throw sim.error;

const receipt = await adapter.submit(req, {
  publicKey: wallet.publicKey.toBase58(),
  signTransaction: async (bytes) => {
    const signed = await wallet.signTransaction(Transaction.from(bytes));
    return signed.serialize();
  },
});
```

Omitting `node.programs` gives you the compiled-in devnet program ID and venue
mints. The adapter never holds a key: builders return a serializable request,
and `submit` hands your signer raw bytes. Matching happens on chain, so there is
no book read to go stale between build and submit.

## Building and testing locally

```sh
pnpm install                               # from repo root
pnpm -F @sooth/sdk-solana build            # tsc compile
pnpm -F @sooth/sdk-solana test             # vitest (litesvm-backed)
```

Tests boot `litesvm`, deploy `sooth_core` from `target/deploy/`, seed the market
fixtures, and exercise the adapter against fresh venue mints. Coverage spans the
AMM flows, the book (placement, matching behaviour, CU budget, heap frame,
events, constants), venue separation and mint defaults, graduation gating and LP,
adjudication end to end, fee distribution, solvency invariants, market close, IDL
freshness, submit retry and priority fee, PDAs, and the LMSR port.

> **Build-step gotcha:** the demo and any consumer ESM caller import from
> `dist/`. After editing `src/`, run `pnpm -F @sooth/sdk-solana build` before
> reloading the dapp — vitest hits `src/` directly, but the bundled consumer does
> not.
