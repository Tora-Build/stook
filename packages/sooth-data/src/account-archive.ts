// Alchemy's Solana Account Archive — `getAccountInfo` at a historical slot.
//
// ## What it gives
//
// The state of any account at any past slot, and the ability to walk an
// account's writes forward or backward:
//
//   - **price history**. `AmmState.q_yes / q_no / b` at a series of slots IS
//     the LMSR price over time, with no trade index needed to chart it.
//   - **point-in-time answers**. "What did the book look like when this
//     happened" stops being a question only an index can answer.
//   - **cheap backfill of STATE**, without replaying transactions.
//
// It also answers the retention problem for accounts specifically: a public
// validator prunes, and this does not.
//
// ## Why it does NOT replace the event indexer
//
// The archive is captured **per slot, not per transaction**. If two
// transactions write the book in the same slot, only the final state is
// stored; the intermediate one is gone.
//
// Our fills are per transaction, and several fills can live inside one:
//
//     FILL 25@530  maker=X taker=Y
//     FILL  5@545  maker=Z taker=Y     <- one transaction, one account write
//
// A state diff across that write shows an order gone, another reduced, and
// three seats changed. It cannot say which maker traded with whom at which
// price, and on a busy market — two transactions in one slot — it cannot even
// see that the first fill happened. Fees are not in the account at all; they
// move to the fee pool. Timestamps are in the event.
//
// So: state diffs answer "what is it now / what was it then". Events answer
// "what happened, to whom, at what price". A trade history needs the second,
// and no amount of account archival produces it.
//
// The right split is to use both — archive for state and charts, the event
// index for history — which is what this module exists to enable.
