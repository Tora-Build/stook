// LMSR price over time, from archived account state.
//
// This is the case where Alchemy's Account Archive genuinely removes work
// rather than duplicating it. The AMM's price is a pure function of three
// numbers held in `AmmState`:
//
//     p_yes = exp(q_yes/b) / (exp(q_yes/b) + exp(q_no/b))
//
// so the price at any past slot is just that account, read at that slot. No
// events, no index, no reconstruction — and one request per WRITE rather than
// per slot, because `firstUpdateAfterSlot` skips the quiet stretches.
//
// Contrast with trade history, which the archive cannot give: fills are per
// transaction and the archive is per slot, so two transactions in one slot
// collapse into one state and the first fill becomes unobservable. Price is
// different precisely because it is a property of STATE, not of an event.
//
// The log-sum-exp shift matches `lmsr.rs` — subtract the max before
// exponentiating — so a market with large `q/b` gives the same answer here as
// on chain instead of overflowing to Infinity.
