// through `scoring.ts`. No server, no database: the chain is the scoreboard.
//
// The RPC is proxied and moderately slow, so this never re-walks history on
// a poll. Each market keeps an `until` cursor (the newest signature already
// decoded) and its play tape in localStorage; a poll costs one signature
// listing per market plus one `getTransaction` per NEW transaction. The
// cached tape also hydrates the board synchronously on page load, so the UI
// shows the last known season while the first refresh runs.
//
// One fetch loop feeds every mount (Navbar's XP pill and the arena sidecar
// render from the same store), keyed by a refcount so the interval exists
// exactly once.
