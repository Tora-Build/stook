// chain-shim/amm-bridge.ts — routes the AMM page's wagmi-shim calls to
// real `SolanaChainAdapter` calls.
//
// Two integration points:
//
//   1. `dispatchAmmRead({ functionName, args }, ctx)` — pattern-matches the
//      `useReadContract` / `usePublicClient.readContract` argument shape
//      upstream's AMM hooks produce, and returns real adapter data formatted
//      to match the EVM tuple shape upstream expects.
//
//      Handled: getLiquidity, getMarketState, getPosition, getPositionQuote,
//      ERC20 balanceOf/allowance/decimals, AMMEngine.getBalances.
//
//      Unhandled function names fall through to the sentinel return so
//      orderbook / launchpad reads keep their existing empty-state behavior.
//
//   2. `dispatchAmmWrite({ functionName, args }, ctx)` — handles
//      `tradePositions` by calling `adapter.buildTrade` + `adapter.submit`.
//      Returns a synthetic Hash compatible with the wagmi return shape.
//      Other write function names (approve, resolve, etc.) are still
//      surfaced as `SolanaForkUnsupported` errors.
//
// The bridge re-shapes Solana adapter outputs into EVM-tuple shapes upstream
// `useDirectRead`-based hooks expect:
//
//   getMarketState  → readonly [qYes, qNo, yesPriceWad]
//   getLiquidity    → bigint (b, in WAD)
//   getPosition     → readonly [yesShares, noShares]
//   getPositionQuote→ readonly [cost, fee, netCost, newYesPrice]   // matches contract
//   getBalances     → readonly [available, locked]
//   balanceOf       → bigint (USDC token base units)
//   allowance       → bigint (large constant; Solana has no approvals)
//   decimals        → 6 (USDC)
