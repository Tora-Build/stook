// chain-shim/portfolio-bridge.ts — routes the Portfolio page's wagmi-shim
// reads to real `SolanaChainAdapter` calls.
//
// Portfolio uses three load-bearing reads:
//
//   1. `LaunchpadEngine.getMarkets()` (in `useOnChainMarkets`) — returns the
//      array of all market addresses on the chain. We fan out to the
//      single seeded market PDA exposed via `DemoContext.marketRef`. Returning
//      `[<marketRef>]` lets `useActivePositions` walk a non-empty list.
//
//   2. `LAUNCHPAD_MARKET_ABI.{isSettled,winningOutcome,price,...}` and
//      `TruthMarket.{questionHash,isSettled,winningOutcome}` — per-market
//      reads upstream's `useOnChainMarkets` and `useActivePositions` issue
//      against the market address. Solana doesn't have separate
//      LaunchpadMarket / TruthMarket / outcome-token contracts; the AMM-
//      backed portfolio surface is the union of `Market` (lifecycle/deadline)
//      and `Position` (yes/no shares) PDAs. We translate to those.
//
//   3. `AMMEngine.getPosition(market, user)` — already routed via amm-bridge.
//      Falls through this dispatcher unchanged.
//
// The portfolio-bridge runs *before* the amm-bridge in `wagmi-shim.ts`'s
// dispatch chain (see comment at the dispatch site). Function names that
// neither bridge claims fall through to the existing sentinel return.
//
// LP-positions / locked-funds / claimable surfaces are intentionally
// "graceful empty": positions render an empty state and the Portfolio page
// still displays the user's AMM positions correctly.
