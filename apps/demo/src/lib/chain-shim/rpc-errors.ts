// Telling "the chain said no" apart from "the chain did not answer".
//
// ## Why this matters
//
// Most shim reads degrade to a harmless empty value when they fail, which is
// right for depth or order lists: a market with no book really does have no
// orders, and stalling the panel on a thrown promise would be worse.
//
// `isGraduated` is not like that. It is a CLAIM, and it decides routing — a
// market that reads as not-graduated has no orderbook tab at all. If a
// transport failure degraded to `false`, an unreachable validator would make
// the orderbook silently vanish, with the app reporting a market as still
// bonding when in fact nothing had been asked.
//
// A missing account and an unreachable RPC are different facts and must not
// collapse to the same answer. This classifies them.
