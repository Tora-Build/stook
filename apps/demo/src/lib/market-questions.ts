// Remembering what a market actually asked.
//
// The program stores `question_hash: [u8; 32]` and nothing else — the text is
// hashed client-side and never sent, so it cannot be read back from chain at
// any price. That is a deliberate cost decision, but it leaves the UI with
// nothing to show: every market renders as its own address, and one base58
// string looks like any other. A user cannot tell the market they just created
// from a seeded one, which is worse than it sounds, because the two route to
// different venues.
//
// So: remember locally what this browser submitted. Deliberately narrow —
//
//   - It only covers markets created in THIS browser. Someone else's market
//     still shows an address, and so does yours on another device. There is no
//     way around that client-side; the durable fix is to emit the question in
//     `MarketCreated` and read it back off the creation transaction, the same
//     way `readBookHistory` reads events, or to run an indexer.
//   - It is a display cache, never a source of truth. Nothing routes, prices
//     or settles on it. The worst a corrupted entry can do is show a wrong
//     title next to a correct address.
//
// localStorage rather than sessionStorage on purpose: a market outlives the
// tab that created it, so a session-scoped store would lose every title the
// moment the tab closed.
