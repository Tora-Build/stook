// Map the demo's order form onto a `book_place` call.
//
// This is the risky part of switching the write path, so it lives here as a
// pure function with tests rather than inline in a 900-line hook.
//
// ## Three encodings meet here
//
// 1. **The form** speaks (outcome, price, isBuy) where price is the price of
//    the thing named by `outcome`.
// 2. **`useOrderbookTrade` uses INVERTED outcome encoding** — `outcome === 0`
//    means YES and `outcome === 1` means NO, the opposite of the protocol's
//    canonical `0 = NO, 1 = YES`. That inversion is load-bearing at the call
//    site (`SoothBookTerminal.tsx`), so it is honoured here rather than
//    "corrected" halfway up the stack, which would silently flip every order.
// 3. **The book** has one axis: a `SIDE_BID` buys YES at tick `t`, a `SIDE_ASK`
//    sells YES at tick `t` — equivalently buys NO at `1 - t`.
//
// ## The four quadrants
//
// | form                | book                          |
// |---------------------|-------------------------------|
// | buy YES at p        | BID at p                      |
// | sell YES at p       | ASK at p                      |
// | buy NO at q         | ASK at 1 - q                  |
// | sell NO at q        | BID at 1 - q                  |
//
// Buying NO is selling YES. That identity is the whole reason the book needs
// one axis instead of two: all four form directions collapse into a side flag
// plus a single complement, with no per-direction special case.
