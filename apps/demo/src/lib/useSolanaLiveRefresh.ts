// Push-based freshness for the Solana fork.
//
// ## Why this exists
//
// The chain-shim's `useWatchContractEvent` is a no-op stub, so the app has no
// EVM-shaped event path to invalidate on. Without this hook it runs on polling
// alone, and a trade can land on-chain while the page keeps showing stale
// numbers until the next interval elapses.
//
// ## Why account subscriptions rather than synthetic logs
//
// The tempting fix is to make `useWatchContractEvent` fabricate EVM-shaped
// logs. That means reproducing event payloads faithfully enough that every
// `log.args.*` read is correct — a large surface where one wrong field is a
// silently wrong toast or a bad refetch.
//
// Solana offers something strictly better. `onAccountChange` delivers the
// account's new STATE, not a delta describing it, so nothing has to be
// reconstructed: when the book or the AMM changes, re-read it. That is also
// the idiom Solana apps use, and it is the same property that lets the
// orderbook be correct without an indexer.
//
// So this subscribes to the accounts backing the UI and invalidates the cached
// reads. Coarse on purpose: refetching a cached account read is cheap, and a
// missed invalidation is a stale balance shown as fact.
