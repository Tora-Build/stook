   *   - `redeemAmmPosition` does the same for the AMM ledger. A trader who
   *     used both venues has to claim from both; neither call can see the
   *     other's balance, so calling one is not a substitute for the other.
   *   - `reclaimSubsidy` returns the creator's unspent LMSR subsidy. It fails
   *     for anyone else: the program binds `lp_position` to the signer.
   *
   * Tried across every known market and reported per market, because a failure
   * usually just means "nothing owed here" and should not abort the others.
   *
   * `positions` sweeps BOTH ledgers rather than exposing them as two buttons.
   * Which venue a fill came from is an implementation detail the trader never
   * chose — the book and the AMM are one order ticket in the UI — so making
   * them press the right one of two identical-looking buttons is a way to
   * leave money unclaimed.
