// True on the EVM book, where selling YES delivers YES tokens and you must
// mint a $1 pair before you can sell either leg. Not true on the redesigned
// book: a YES and a NO always sum to $1, so selling YES at p IS buying NO at
// (1 - p), collateralised in USDC, with the seat carrying the negative
// position. Verified on chain — a wallet holding only USDC reached net -2
// having never held an outcome token.
//
// So the gate rejected orders the program accepts.
