# Boot the validator ALONE, detached from vite.
#
# `dev-localnet.sh` runs vite in the foreground and traps its exit to stop the
# validator. That is right for a one-command demo, and wrong for development:
# restarting vite to pick up a code change also kills the chain. The symptom is
# nasty — the UI keeps working, every on-chain read quietly degrades to empty,
# and the market reads as "not graduated", so the orderbook simply disappears
# with nothing on screen saying the chain is gone.
#
# This script boots only the validator and leaves it running. Restart vite as
# often as you like; the chain outlives it.
#
#   bash scripts/localnet-up.sh          # boot (leaves ledger intact if warm)
#   bash scripts/localnet-up.sh --reset  # wipe and boot clean
#   bash scripts/localnet-down.sh        # stop it
#
# After a --reset, re-seed with:  bash scripts/seed-fixture.sh <wallet>
