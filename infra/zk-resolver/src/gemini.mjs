// Gemini: advisory only, and strictly OFF the resolution path.
//
// # The boundary, stated once
//
// An outcome is decided by exactly one thing: the on-chain comparator, applied
// to a value that came out of a signed attestation. That happens inside
// `sooth_core`, in `zk::verify_attestation`. No language model participates in
// it, and no code in this file is reachable from `resolveMarket` — the
// resolution loop never imports this module.
//
// What Gemini may do here is help a HUMAN author a rule before it goes on
// chain, and flag a registry entry that reads as ambiguous. Both are
// pre-registration authoring aids whose output a person reads and acts on.
// Neither produces a value, an outcome, or a transaction.
//
// This boundary is not a matter of discipline, it is structural: the model is
// never handed an attestation, and the only thing it returns is prose. Even a
// maximally wrong answer from `reviewRule` cannot change what a market
// resolves to, because the market's rule is already committed as `rule_hash`
// and the outcome is computed on chain from a signature this file never sees.
//
// Usage is manual:  node src/index.mjs --review

// Pinned model names are retired out from under callers — this one had become a
// 404, which surfaced only when someone ran --review. Overridable so the next
// retirement is an env change rather than a patch, and a lite default because
// this call reads one rule and writes a paragraph.
